# powershell
Assorted scripts for user admin tasks written in powershell.

Some of these scripts had some company specific terms, domains, or server names written into them. These have been removed for publishing on github.

These scripts are in various states of completedness. I've moved on from the company where I was working on these and I'm unlikely to pick up these specific scripts in future. These are uploaded for personal reference or in case any other individuals happen to find them useful.
